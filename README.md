# Object-Oriented Frogger
This is an in-development object-oriented JavaScript project that will allow users to play a custom Frogger style of game.

## How to Use the Program
Open index.html to get started. You can use your keyboard's arrow keys to move the player character.

## Note
This is currently in development. The main programming I have contributed can be found in js/app.js. Engine.js and Resources.js are engine files that the game is built on.

Elements yet to be implemented:

* Moving enemies.
* A scoreboard.
* Failure conditions.
* Success conditions.
