# Object-Oriented Frogger
This is an in-development object-oriented JavaScript ES5 game that plays similar to the retro classic Frogger.

## How to Use the Program
Open index.html to get started. You can use your keyboard's arrow keys to move the player character or the 'c' key to change your sprite.

## Note
This game is currently in development. The main programming I have contributed can be found in js/app.js.

Elements to soon be implemented:

* Randomized rock locations in the water to make the game more challenging.
* Power ups that randomly spawn in the game field.
* Improvements to visual style of the modals.
