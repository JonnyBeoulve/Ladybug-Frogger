# Object-Oriented Frogger
This is an in-development object-oriented JavaScript ES5 game that plays similar to the retro classic Frogger.

## How to Use the Program
Download the project and place it into a folder. Then, open index.html to get started.

Once in-game, you can use your keyboard's arrow keys to move the player character or the 'c' key to change your sprite.

## Note
This game is currently in development. The main programming I have contributed can be found in js/app.js.

Work left to be done:

* Power ups that randomly spawn in the game field.
* A timer.
* Refactoring.
