# Object-Oriented Frogger
This is an object-oriented JavaScript ES5 game that plays similar to the retro classic Frogger.

## How to Use the Program
Download the project and place it into a folder. Then, open index.html to get started.

Once in-game, you can use your keyboard's arrow keys to move the player character or the 'c' key to change your sprite.

## Programming
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES5)

## Note
The main programming I have contributed can be found in js/app.js.

In the future the following will be added for this project:

* Sounds.
* Power ups that randomly spawn in the game field.
* Refactoring.
