# Ladybug Frogger
This is an object-oriented JavaScript ES6 game that plays similar to the retro classic Frogger.

## How to Use the Program
Demo: http://www.jonathanleack.com/ladybug-frogger/

## Programming
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript (ES6)

## Note
The main programming I have contributed can be found in js/app.js.

In the future the following will be added for this project:

* Sounds.
* Power ups that randomly spawn in the game field.
* Refactoring.

This game was originally built using JavaScript ES5 syntax, and I have since updated it with ES6 classes, arrow functions, declarations, and more.
